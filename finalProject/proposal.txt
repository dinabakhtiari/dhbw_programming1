Project: 
1. Project Vision
The "World Capitals Quiz Master" is an interactive desktop application designed to test and improve the user's geographical knowledge. The app fetches real-time data from an online API and challenges the user to identify the correct capital city for a given country
2. Components & Architecture
To ensure the project is well-organized, it will be divided into the following components:
•	API Client: Fetches a country and its capital from a public API in JSON format to display in the quiz.
•	Data Format: Uses JSON for country and capital info.
•	Quiz Engine (Core Logic):
o	Question Generator: Randomly selects a country.
o	Option Shuffler: Creates 4 multiple-choice options (1 correct, 3 distractors).
o	Matching Logic: Compares the user’s click with the correct answer and updates the game state.
•	Score Manager: Keeps track of points and the number of questions remaining.
•	GUI (JavaFX Interface): A window containing:
o	A label for the country name.
o	Interactive buttons for the 4 choices.
o	A progress bar or score label.
3. Tech Stack
•	Programming Language: Java 
•	UI design: JavaFX 
•	Data handling: JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
•	Data Source: API

4. Coding Concepts (What I will use)
This project covers the core topics of the course:
•	Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):
o	Classes
o	Encapsulation: Using private fields and getters/setters for data security.
•	Data Structures:
o	ArrayList
•	Data Types
•	Control Flow:
o	If-Else Statements: For the Matching Logic (checking if the user clicked the right button).
o	Loops: For iterating through the data to find random "wrong" answers.
•	Exception Handling: Using try-catch blocks to manage potential internet connection issues (API errors).
•	Data Manipulation
5. Expected Results
•	A functional desktop app where a user can play a full round of 10 questions.
•	The ability to restart the game without closing the app.
•	A visual feedback system (e.g., green for correct, red for wrong).
